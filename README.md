# Graffiti AI: Generative Adversarial Style Transfer for Artists

## Abstract
This repository presents Graffiti AI, an approach to artistic style transfer using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Graffiti AI is a collaborative research project between Andrew Stepin and street art and graffiti artist Linelogic. The goal of the project is to develop a GAN model capable of learning artist distinctive style from his existing artworks and sketches, and subsequently generating new unique images that capture the essence of his style. The proposed method leverages the power of adversarial training to separate and recombine the content and style representations of images, enabling the generation of new artworks that preserve the artist's unique visual aesthetics while introducing novel content.
